Voight-Kampff
=============
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nbit001/voight-kampff.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nbit001/voight-kampff)

Voight-Kampff relies on [user agent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent) list for its detection. It can easily tell you if a request is coming from a crawler, spider or bot. This can be especially helpful in analytics such as page hit tracking.

Installation
============
`gem install voight_kampff`

Configuration
=============

A YAML file is used to match [user agent strings](http://simplyfast.info/browser) to their types.

If you'd like to use an [updated list](http://www.user-agents.org/) or make your own customizations, run `rake voight_kampff:import_user_agents`. This will download a user_agents.yml file into your Rails `/config` directory.

To use [Regular Expression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) matching, just set `string_match: regex` in your user_agent entry. The first match will be used so you should probably put your Regular Expression entries toward the bottom of the file.

Usage
=====
There are three ways to use Voight-Kampff

1. In your [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) controllers:  
   `request.bot?`

2. Through the `VoightKampff` module:  
   `VoightKampff.bot? 'your user agent string'`

3. Through a `VoightKampff::Test` instance:  
   `VoightKampff::Test.new('your user agent string').bot?`

All of the above examples accept `human?`, `bot?`, `browser?`, `checker?`, `downloader?`, `proxy?`, `crawler?` and `spam?` methods. All of these methods will return `true`, `false`, or `nil` (if it doesn't recognize the user agent).
